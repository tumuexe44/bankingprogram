# bankingprogram
This simple command-line banking program allows users to manage their account balance through basic operations such as viewing the balance, making deposits, and withdrawing funds. The program ensures input validation for deposit and withdrawal amounts and provides feedback for invalid actions, such as withdrawing more than the available balance or entering negative amounts.

Features:
Show Balance: Displays the current balance in a clear format.
Deposit: Allows users to add funds to their balance with input validation.
Withdraw: Lets users withdraw funds, ensuring there are sufficient funds and that the input is positive.
Exit: Cleanly exits the program with a thank-you message.
This project is a good starting point for beginners learning Python, covering essential concepts such as conditionals, loops, input handling, and function use.
